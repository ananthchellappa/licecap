Upwork post : 

LICEcap is a free open-source software that can record a portion of your screen and generate a looping image file (Eg. GIF). (link removed) Currently, it provides only start, pause and stop. I want to add a dashcam (dashboard camera) (aka cockpit voice recorder black-box) style loop recording option so that one can have it record continuously on a (chosen - default 10 seconds) loop and, when a particular even occurs, choose to stop the recording and have all of the last N seconds saved - which would be very useful for bug reports related to difficult-to-reproduce cases.
